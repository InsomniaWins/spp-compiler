// this is a sample program of skibidi++
// you can type comments with "//"
# or you can even do "#"

// variables can be declared without initialization (null default value)
bet mew;
yap("mew: " + mew);

// they can also be defined in same instruction and declaration
bet mog = 5;
// or be defined after declaration
mew = 2;

// yap your results with string + generic concatination
yap("mew: " + mew);
yap("mog: " + mog);

// math will also work in same statement
yap("mew + mog = " + mew * mog);

// and finally . . .
// a "Hello, World!" program
bet sigma = "Hello, Rizzlers!";
yap(sigma);
